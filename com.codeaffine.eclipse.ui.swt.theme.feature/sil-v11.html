<h2> SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE </h2>

<p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
<a name='c6e67051'></a>
<h3> PREAMBLE</h3>

<p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br />
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br />
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br />
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br />
with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br />
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br />
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br />
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br />
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br />
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br />
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br />
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
